Each part should be 2G
What is the filter 
It hsould 
Play with alluxio configuration

--> can 

We need to know the figure in my phone for the DAG of tpcds
We will have per operator per host node analysis based on input and out put 

What ever the entity does it generates another pig script which contains the prefetching commands.




-----------> for next week:
			-> finish up hadoop experiments: fix the prfobmel
				-> run with 2GB
			-> IF we can use pig load to prefetch into alluxio cache 
			-> make pig script execution pretty ()
			-> draw three figures and add them to the paper : 1. exection plan, (2,3) time series exectution w/wo prefetch 
			-> write an algorithm that figure out when to prefetch from a dag (to the paper repo)
------------> for future
			-> new o1

To create a workload, we create a pool of 19 tpc-ds~\cite{PIG-TPCDS} and 
22 tpc-h~\cite{PIG-TPCH} benchmarks written in PIG. 

We generate datasets of size 1GB, 4GB, 8GB, 10GB, 16GB, 32GB, 48GB, 64GB, and 80GB
for both TPCH and TPCDS benchmarks, using the dataset generator in
~\cite{datasetgen}. Our pool in total has 328 queries. We use the same set of 
queries on the same datasets for Spark experiment.


To build a runtime prediction model, we build a pool of queries with 
different setup when there is a cluster of size 2 nodes, 
8 nodes and 16 nodes with the bandwidth equal to 40Gbps, 20Gbps, 
10Gbps and 5Gbps and 1Gbps, and with different datasets of sizes 
of 1GB, 4GB, 8GB, 10GB, 16GB, 32GB, 48GB, 64GBe, and 80GB and 
with 0%, 10%, 20% ... 90% and 100% of data in the cache. In 
total, we captured 50 data points to train the Pig and 50 data
points to train the Spark runtime prediction models.

At each point of time, we submit 10 queries in batch and wait
for all of them to be finished. To select queries, we select
queries with similarites and we test the following senarios
-----1. 10 queries, 2, 1 queries with on the same input and the size is selected randomly --> select 8 datasets
-----2. 10 queries, 4, 1 the same as above
-----3. 10 queries, 6, 1 the same as above
4. 10 queries, 2, 2 which means we would have two sets of two queries with the same input
5. 10 queries, 2, 3 which means we would have two sets of 3 queries with the same input 
6. 10 queries, 3, 3 which means we would have 3 set of queries with 3 inputs
7. 10 queries, 2, 4 
8. 10 queries, 4, 2 which means 
-----9. 10 queries, no sharing
10.10 queries, 3, 2 which means we would have 3 sets of queries with two inputs 

To do this, first select the datasets and then select 
the queries.

Use these 150 queries to compute the runtime predicion
model.


# Step 1 run all of tpch queries and build their operation sets
and their DAG on dataset of 20GB with Bandwidth 40 Gbps. Among
those selec unique queries and from unique operations and then
select unique queries.
